## Troubleshooting

### FAQs

- **SE crashes when I import the script/When I open the `Scripts` Tab!!**
  - This is due to duplicate scripts existing in your scripts folder. Head over to your File Manager and navigate to your Scripts Folder and Delete all the duplicate scripts.

- **Failed to Import Script!**
  - You have to first give SE access to your Scripts Folder.(To do this, head over to the Scripts Tab in SE)
 
- **Tapping on Import From URL Button Does Nothing!**
  - Please follow the `Download from GitHub` method.

- **Script Not Working:**
  - Ensure the script is placed in the correct folder.
  - Check if the script is enabled in SE.

- **Toasts not showing up sometimes**
  - Scripts like custom_toast.js, greetings_toast.js, etc which are based on toasts require Snapchat to be closed completely then opened. If you have just pressed the home button to exit Snapchat and reopened Snapchat again, the toast might not show up. You also need to clear Snapchat from the recents menu or exit it properly in order for the toast to show up.
